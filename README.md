# Sefed_game
Sefed is a fast-paced target shooting game inspired by the vibrant culture of Ethiopia. In this game, players must tap on beautifully designed "Sefed" (woven Ethiopian baskets) targets before they disappear. The game challenges players' reflexes and precision while offering an engaging cultural touch through its design elements.
